# medium

This repo is set up with the intention of allowing Medium readers to directly edit the content of articles I create.

When using Medium as a reference for some technical topics, the passion from developers on display, both from favorable and unfavorable reception, usually just manifests in the comments. It is by setting up this access that I hope to redirect the energy (and insight!) from those critical to something more constructive.
