# medium

This repo is set up with the intention of allowing Medium readers to directly edit the content of articles created under the medium/5x5 publication.

When using Medium as a reference for some technical topics, the passion from developers on display, both from favorable and unfavorable reception, usually just manifests in the comments. Setting up this access hopefully will redirect the energy (and insight!) from those critical to something more constructive.
